# Github Contributions Are Bullshit.

More specifically,
[Github's rules for what counts as a contribution](https://help.github.com/articles/why-are-my-contributions-not-showing-up-on-my-profile/)
are bullshit.

* Not counting commits made in forks disincentivizes prospective Open
  Source patches.
* Not counting commits made in branches discourages the best practice
  of working in a branch and only merging to master once the work is
  fully complete.

On the one hand, you can say, if you think they're bullshit, why
bother looking at them — and that's a fair point. I encourage people
to not care about the GitHub Contributions graph if that's at all an
option for them.

However, for me, the contributions graph provides an easy way to track
a personal goal — to make at least one Open Source-related commit a
day, however large or small. It's an easy and public way to hold
myself accountable to my goal. So, in order to make that happen, when
I make a change that isn't counted, I'll make a note in this `README`
file, and push that change up. Problem solved.

# These Too Are Contributions
