# Github contributions are bullshit.

More specifically,
[Github's rules for what counts as a contribution](https://help.github.com/articles/why-are-my-contributions-not-showing-up-on-my-profile/)
are bullshit.

* Not counting commits made in forks disincentivizes prospective Open
  Source contributions
* Not counting commits made in branches discourages the best practice
  of working on changes in a branch and only merging to master once
  that's complete

On the one hand, you can say, if you think they're bullshit, why
bother looking at them -- and that's a fair point. I encourage people
to not care about the Github contribution tracking if that's at all an
option for them.

However, for me, the contribution graph provides an easy way to track
a personal goal -- to make at least one Open Source-related commit a
day, however large or small. So, in order to make that happen, when I
make a change that isn't counted, I'll make a note in this README
file, and push that change up. Problem solved.

# These too are contributions
